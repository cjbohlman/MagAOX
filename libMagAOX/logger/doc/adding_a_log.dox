Steps to adding a new log type:

1) Add an event code to the eventCodeT enum in logCodes.hpp
2) add the type to logTypes.hpp (possibly adding a basic type to logTypesBasics.hpp).
   -- This in includes coding the format(), extract(), and msgString() methods for that type.
3) Add the new log type to the switch-case statement in logStdFormat.hpp
