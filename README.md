# The MagAOX Software System

This is the software which runs the MagAOX ExAO system.  

## Dependencies

### Current:
1. mxlib (https://github.com/jaredmales/mxlib)
2. libudev (for introspective device discovery)
3. zlib1g-dev [ubuntu]

### Future
1. libhdf5 (though not for anything currently implemented, but we will)

## Configuration

To configure the build, the following macros can be used.  Their default values are set in
the headers in `libMagAOX/common/`.  To override at build time they can be redefined in `local/config.mk` [how?]

#### Environment Variables

These are defined in `libMagAOX/common/environment.hpp`

- `MAGAOX_env_path`, the name of the environment variable holding the base path to the MagAOX system directories.  Default = "MagAOX_PATH"

- `MAGAOX_env_config`, the name of the environment variable holding the relative path to the config files.  Default = "MagAOX_CONFIG".

## Building

A rudimentary build system has been implemented.

To build an app, cd the app's directory and type
```
make -f ../../Make/magAOXApp.mk t=<appname>
```
replacing `appname` with the name of the application.

To build a utility, cd to the utility's directory and type
```
make -f ../../Make/magAOXUtil.mk t=<utilname>
```
replacing `utilname` with the name of the utility.

The difference between the two Makefiles is in install, in that MagAO-X Applications get setuid, whereas the utilities do not.

Some notes:

* libMagAOX (part of this repository) is a c++ header-only library.  It is compiled into a pre-compiled-header (PCH), managed by the build system.  Any changes to libMagAOX should trigger a re-compile of the PCH, and of any apps depending on it.

* Allowing setuid for RT priority handling, access to ttys and FIFOs, etc., requires hardcoding LD_LIBRARY_PATH at build time.  This is done in the makefiles, and so should be transparent.

* Install requires root privileges.

ToDo:
- [] Use environment variables for path to various parts of build system, path to libMagAOX PCH, etc.
- [] Possibly use name of directory for target app name.

## System Setup

The following are the default MagAOX system directories.  

```
/opt/MagAOX               [MagAOX system directory]
/opt/MagAOX/bin           [Contains all applications]
/opt/MagAOX/drivers
/opt/MagAOX/drivers/fifos
/opt/MagAOX/config        [Contains the configuration files for the applications]
/opt/MagAOX/logs          [Directory where logs are written by the applications] (chown :xlog, chmod g+w, chmod g+s)
/opt/MagAOX/sys           [Directory for application status files, e.g. PID lock-files]
/opt/MagAOX/secrets       [Directory containing device passwords, etc.]
```

 This directory structure is #define-ed in libMagAOX/common/defaults.hpp.  It is created, with the proper permissions, by the script `setup/makeDirs.sh`.  It is also specified in `local/config.mk`.  Changing this isn't yet very simple, but we intend for it to be possible to have parallel installations.

ToDo:
- [] Investigate using appropriate environment variables to allow overriding these.
- [] Investigate having the defines be passed in via make.  E.g. `-DMAGAOX_default_path=/opt/MagAOX-DEV` will override, maybe we should just inherit from `local/config.mk`

On install, symlinks are made for executables from `/usr/local/bin` to `/opt/MagAOX/bin`.

## Documentation

The code is more-or-less carefully documented with doxygen, though the doxyfile has not been created.

- [] Init doxygen doc system
- [] Decide: do we use github pages, or host it on one of the snazzy magao-x domains?
