# The LBTI library.

This code is originally from the LBTI project.  The original authors are Elwood Downey and Paul Grenz.  We have modified the structure to be used as part of MagAO-X.  It will need to be periodically updated with bug-fixes, etc., from the LBTI_INDI code base.

This builds to a shared library, liblbti.so, which is installed in the $(LIB_DIR) defined in the MagAO-X common makefile.
